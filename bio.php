      <p>My name is Christian and I am studying math and data science at Iowa State University. I live in a fraternity house very close to campus. The chapter, ACACIA, holds academics and human service to a very high standard. We have weekly service projects and just recently started a new philanthropy selling acai bowls to raise money for Youth and Sheltered Services. </p>
      <p>I spend most of my time at the library, at my house, or at work. One of my jobs is at a company called Kingland that is right next to campus. There I do financial research. My primary job is at the Iowa State Daily, the student newspaper. I currently hold the title of Digital Editor for Analytics. My main job is to send out daily analytic reports, but also present to the newsroom on occasion. I am also left to my own volition much of the time, so I am allowed to experiment with new ideas and try to impliment better data practice in the newsroom.</p>
      <p>I am also studying French in school. I have always wanted to live abroad, even if just for a short amount of time. I plan on studying in France in the Spring of 2020.
